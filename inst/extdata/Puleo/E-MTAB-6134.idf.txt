Protocol Description	Prior to hybridization, 4 μg of fragmented cDNA in a 6xSSPE-T hybridization buffer (1 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris pH 7.6, 0.005% Triton), was heated to 95°C for 5 min before loading onto the Affymetrix GeneTitan System. Affymetrix U219 Array Plates were used.	scanning was performed using the Affymetrix GeneTitan System according to the manufacturer’s instructions	Affymetrix transcriptomic data were normalized using RMA. Batch effect correction was applied to normalize the clinical center of origin of each sample using ComBat (PMID:22257669).	RNA was extracted using the ALLPrep FFPE tissue kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) following manufacturer’s instructions.	100 ng RNA was used as starting material for the biotin-labelled cDNA preparation. For the labelling procedure, the Affymetrix Sensation FFPE and 3’IVT kit (Affymetrix Santa Clara CA, USA) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.	Multicentric collection of samples; Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks from 80 resected PDA tumors from the Brussels cohort and 232 from the French cohort (Pitié Salpètrière, Saint Antoine, and Ambroise Paré hospitals). Specialist pancreatic pathologists confirmed the presence of neoplastic cells and selected a representative FFPE tumor block after examination of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides; [tumour grading] is defined as the classical grade given by the pathologiste: \"how closely the cancer looks like normal tissue under a microscope\"; [resection margin] is defined as: the margin of apparently non-tumerous tissue around a tumor that has been surgically removed with grades: R0 - no cancer cells seen microscopically at the resection margin; R1 - cancer cells present microscopically at the resection margin (microscopic positive margin); R2 - gross examination by the naked eye shows tumor tissue present at the resection margin (macroscopic positive margin). OS.delay: the Overall survival time.; OS.event: the death status at time of the last follow up. 0: patient alive, 1: dead; DFS.delay: disease free survival.= progression free survival. DFS.event: 1: progression. 0: No progression; hightumcelclassif and wholetumcellclassif are described as follows: An Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was performed on the transcriptomic dataset to retrieve the 10 most robust and reproducible independent components. Components corresponding to biological signals of interest were determined by Pearson’s product moment correlation on individual gene expression and ANOVA on patient characteristics. The 10 components were used to predict the mean variant allele frequency of each sample as a surrogate of sample purity using an elastic net model. High tumor cellularity classification and whole tumor classification were obtained using a consensus clustering approach on gene expression after removing technical bias and normal contamination components; Average vaf: the average Variant Allelle Frequency (VAF) defined  by targeted sequencing, and the MCPcounter scores (https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1070-5).
