Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcriptional profiling by array of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma xenograft models
Experiment Description	We generated novel patient derived xenograft (PDX) and cell line -derived xenograft models for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) which reflect different molecular subtypes. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is currently the tumor with the fourth highest mortality rate. Recently, subtypes of PDAC have been reported by Collisson et al (Nat. Med. 17(4) 2011. DOI: 10.1038/nm.2344). However current fetal calf serum (FCS) cultured cell lines do not accurately model these subtypes. We thus generated novel serum-free cell lines derived from primary patient xenografts. We here analyse the gene-expression profiles of the xenografts and the derived cell lines. We show that indeed three different subtypes can be separated in our models based on gene-expression data. Further, we identify upregulation of a drug-detoxification pathway specifically in xenografts and cell lines of one of the subtypes. These models and data will help to better understand inter-patient heterogeneity in PDAC and identify novel drug targets and diagnostic markers.

Protocol Description	Cell lines were cultured in vitro in serum free medium containing growth factors EGF, bFGF and IGF-1. The cell lines were primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PACO) cells derived in our laboratory from patient-derived xenografts and named as indicated in the manuscript and sample description. Cells were cultured in Primaria plates under adherent conditions and 5%CO2 at 37Â°C.	Cell-line derived xenografts. Xenografts were initiated by injection 100.000 tumor cells into the pancreas of immune deficient mice (NSG, Jax laboratories). Tumors were grown to a size of <= 1cm3, typically between 1-3 months (depending on cell line). Cell lines were primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PACO) cell lines derived in our laboratory and named as described in our manuscript and the sample information.	Patient samples grown as xenografts (PDX). Xenografts were established from surgically removed tumor specimens by transplanting pieces of 1mm3 size onto the pancreas of immune deficient mice (NSG mice, Jax laboratories). Tumors were grown to a size of >= 1cm3, typically 2-5 months. Patients with resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were recruited at the department of surgery at the university hospital Heidelberg, Germany. To harvest the tumors, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, the tumors were removed and macroscopically dissected to remove the remains of the normal pancreas. The tumor was cut in half, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80Â°C until RNA preparation.	Qiagen RnEasy Mini Kit. Frozen tissue samples were homogenized in Qiazol using the Qiashredder according to the manufacturersâ instructions. Cultured cells were harvested directly by addition of Qiazol to the culture dishes. Samples were then further homogenized using the Qiashredder. Samples were processed with the Qiagen RnEasy Mini kit according to the manufacturersâ instructions.	RNA (500 ng per sample) were labelled using the IlluminaÂ® TotalPrepâ¢ RNA Amplification Kit according to the manufacturers' instructions.	cRNA was hybridized to human whole-genome Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip (Illumina, Inc.)	Quantile normalization with Illumina Bead Studio	BeadChips were scanned with an Illumina iScan system (Illumina Inc.) Scanning and feature extraction was performed using BeadScan and BeadStudio sofware (Illumina) with standard settings for the chips used.
